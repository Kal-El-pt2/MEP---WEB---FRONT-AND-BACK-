Conventional treatments like inhalers and medications are crucial, but integrating complementary therapies such as yoga and Ayurveda can offer additional relief. This article explores how these ancient practices can help manage asthma, supported by scientific evidence. Recent research highlights yoga as a promising complementary therapy for asthma management.
